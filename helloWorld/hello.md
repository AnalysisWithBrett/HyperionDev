# Holiday Calculator

This is a simple Python program designed as an exercise to test your knowledge of using functions and `if-else` statements. The program calculates the estimated total cost of your holiday based on the destination, rental car duration, and the number of nights you plan to stay.

## Description

The Holiday Calculator is an oversimplified Python program created for educational purposes. It serves as an exercise to test my understanding of implementing functions and `if-else` statements in Python programming. While the calculator provides basic functionality for estimating holiday expenses, it is intentionally kept simple to focus on fundamental programming concepts.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to practice and reinforce my understanding of functions and conditional statements in Python programming. By building a holiday calculator that incorporates these concepts, I can enhance my skills while gaining practical experience in python programming.
