# Python Basics Showcase

This repository serves as a showcase of my progress in learning the basics of Python. Through various projects, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental concepts such as manipulating strings, working with data types, implementing conditional statements and loops, creating user-defined functions, handling file input/output operations, and utilizing object-oriented programming principles.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each focusing on different aspects of Python programming:

### 1. Getting Started
- **File:** `helloWorld.py`
- This introductory project focuses on establishing variables to understand differences between data types such as float, string, integers, and binary. It includes basic print statements and data type conversion.

### 2. Data Types and Conditions
- **Files:** `manipulation.py`, `numbers.py`, `awards.py`
- These projects involve using input statements and manipulating data, including calculating lengths, performing basic mathematical operations, finding indices within strings, and replacing characters. The `awards.py` program simulates determining awards for participants in a triathlon based on their total completion time.

### 3. Iteration
- **File:** `patterns.py`, `while.py`
- This project demonstrates the use of loop statements to reduce code length, prevent errors, and promote code reusability. The `patterns.py` program outputs a specific pattern using an if-else statement combined with a for loop.

### 4. User-defined Functions
- **File:** `holiday.py`
- The focus here is on creating custom functions to tackle complex tasks. The `holiday.py` program calculates the estimated total cost of a holiday based on various factors such as destination, rental car duration, and number of nights stayed.

### 5. Handling Strings, Lists, and Dictionaries
- **Files:** `alternative.py`, `cafe.py`
- These projects delve into more advanced string handling techniques and demonstrate working with lists and dictionaries. `alternative.py` modifies a string by alternating upper and lower case characters, while `cafe.py` calculates the total value of items on a cafe menu using lists and dictionaries.

### 6. File I/O Operations
- **Files:** `dob_task.py`, `student_register.py`
- These projects involve reading from and writing to files. `dob_task.py` reads data from a text file containing a list of people's information and prints it in a specific format to separate out the date of births and the full name, while `student_register.py` allows users to register students for an exam venue and exports the data to a text file to create a registration form.

### 7. Classes
- **File:** `email.py`
- This project introduces object-oriented programming principles through the creation of a simple email simulator. The `email.py` program simulates sending and receiving emails with options to view new emails, read emails, and log out.

## Conclusion

Through these projects, I have explored various aspects of Python programming, from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming. Each project represents a step in my learning journey, showcasing my ability to tackle challenges and solve problems using Python. I hope these projects serve as both educational resources and inspiration for others on their Python learning path.
